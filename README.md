Instruction

MinesSeeker is an Android App for playing mines seeker game. The game if pretty much similiar to the well known old classic mine 
seeker game. Users are able to set up the game size i.e. the size of the board. Since the board is essentially a mxn matrix, users 
are able to set up the number of columns and the number of rows manually. In addition to that, users are able to select the number
of mines/treasures there are in the game. During the game, when the user click on a grid with a mine, the grid will reveal the mine.
If user clicked a grid without a mine, a numerical number will be revealed. Such number is the representation of the sum of the 
number of mines there are in the selected column and row. The goal of this game is to find all the mines within a short time. 
The total time of user clicked the grid will be recorded, less the time the better result.
